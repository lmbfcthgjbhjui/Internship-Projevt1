Face Mask Detection With Live Alert System
Alright, let's get cracking on Project 1 and Project 2! These look like fun, hands-on projects. I'll approach this just like I would if I were an intern tackling these challenges.

**Project 1: Face Mask Detection with Live Alert System**

This one's pretty timely and has a cool real-world application. Here's my mental checklist and how I'll proceed:

1.  **Dataset:** The hint mentions a Kaggle dataset. I'll head over there and search for a well-structured dataset of masked and unmasked faces. If I can't find one perfect, I might look for a few smaller datasets and combine them. Data quality is key!

2.  **Preprocessing:** Once I have the images, I'll definitely need to preprocess them. This will likely involve:
    * Resizing all images to a consistent size for the model.
    * Converting them to grayscale to reduce complexity (though I might experiment with keeping color later).
    * Normalizing the pixel values to be between 0 and 1.

3.  **Model Building (CNN with Keras):** I'll use TensorFlow and Keras to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). A basic CNN architecture would involve convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers at the end for classification (masked/unmasked). I'll need to choose the number of layers, filter sizes, activation functions (like ReLU), and the final output layer with a sigmoid activation for binary classification.

4.  **Training and Validation:** I'll split my dataset into training and validation sets. The validation set will help me monitor the model's performance during training and prevent overfitting. I'll train the model for a reasonable number of epochs, keeping an eye on the validation accuracy.

5.  **Integration with OpenCV:** This is where it gets interactive! I'll use OpenCV to capture video from my webcam. For each frame, I'll need to:
    * Detect faces. The hint suggests using Haar Cascades, which is a good starting point for real-time face detection due to its speed.
    * For each detected face, I'll preprocess it in the same way I did the training images.
    * Feed the preprocessed face to my trained CNN model to predict if a mask is present.

6.  **Alert System:** If the model predicts "no mask," I'll need to add some logic to trigger an alert. This could be a simple text overlay on the video feed, a sound, or both.

7.  **Deployment (Optional with Flask):** If time permits, deploying a simple web interface using Flask where someone could upload an image or stream their webcam would be a cool bonus.

**Deliverables for Project 1:**

* A well-commented Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing the entire workflow (data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, and real-time detection).
* The trained model file (e.g., a `.h5` file from Keras).
* A short video demo showcasing the real-time face mask detection with the alert system.
* A link to the GitHub repository containing all the code and potentially the dataset (if allowed by the source).

**Project 2: AI Virtual Career Counsellor**

This one involves Natural Language Processing (NLP) and building a chatbot. Hereâ€™s my plan:

1.  **Intents:** I'll start by brainstorming a list of common interests or areas people might inquire about when thinking about careers. The hint gives examples like "tech," "arts," and "commerce." I'll expand on this list. For each intent, I'll need to create several example phrases or questions a user might ask.

2.  **Text Preprocessing (NLTK):** When a user types in their interests, I'll use NLTK to preprocess the text. This will likely involve:
    * Tokenization (breaking the text into words).
    * Lowercasing.
    * Removing stop words (common words like "the," "is," "a" that don't carry much meaning).
    * Potentially stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their root form.

3.  **Rasa Chatbot Training:** I'll use Rasa to build the chatbot. This will involve defining:
    * **Intents:** The categories of user intentions (as defined in step 1).
    * **Entities (Optional):** Specific pieces of information the user might provide (e.g., specific subjects they like).
    * **Stories (Sample Dialogues):** Examples of how a conversation might flow, including user inputs and the chatbot's responses.
    * **NLU (Natural Language Understanding) Model:** Rasa will use this to understand user input and map it to the defined intents and entities. I'll likely use the default DIET (Dual Intent and Entity Transformer) architecture.
    * **Policies (Dialogue Management):** These define how the chatbot should respond based on the current state of the conversation.

4.  **Career Recommendation Logic:** This is the core of the chatbot. I'll need to create a mapping between the identified intents (and potentially entities) and relevant career paths. This might involve a simple dictionary or a more sophisticated rule-based system. For example, if a user expresses interest in "tech" and "problem-solving," the chatbot might recommend careers like software engineer or data analyst.

5.  **Frontend with Streamlit:** To make the chatbot interactive, I'll build a simple user interface using Streamlit. This will allow users to type in their interests and receive career recommendations.

6.  **Testing:** I'll thoroughly test the chatbot with various user inputs to ensure it understands different phrasings and provides relevant recommendations.

7.  **Deployment (Optional via Streamlit Cloud):** If possible, deploying the Streamlit app to Streamlit Cloud would make it easily accessible.

**Deliverables for Project 2:**

* The complete Rasa project folder containing all the NLU, dialogue management, and domain files.
* The Streamlit frontend UI code.
* A short video demonstrating a sample interaction with the career counsellor chatbot.
* A link to the GitHub repository containing all the code. If deployed, the Streamlit Cloud link as well.

**General Approach for Both Projects:**

* **Iterative Development:** I'll start with a basic implementation and gradually add more features and improvements.
* **Clear Code:** I'll make sure my code is well-commented and easy to understand.
* **Version Control:** I'll use Git and GitHub to manage my code and track changes.
* **Documentation:** My `README.md` file in the repository will clearly explain the project, the steps involved, how to run the code, and any important details.
* **Report:** I'll keep the final 1-2 page report in mind as I work, documenting the introduction, abstract, tools used, steps involved, and conclusion for one of the projects (as per the guidelines).
